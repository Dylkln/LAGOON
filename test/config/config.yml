# ======================================== PREPROCESSING ========================================= #


# Either a file containing all paths to fasta format file(s), or path(s) to fasta format file(s).
# if several files are provided the program will concatenate all the files first.
#fasta: tr/*
fasta: tr_files_test/*

# If you already have some files that you created before, and you wish them to be processed by the
# workflow, you can put their names in the appropriate place in this config file.

# The path of the file containing all sequences you need to treat. By default,
# this file will be named "all_data.fasta".
concat_file: results/all_data.fasta

# The path of the diamond database format created by the command "makedb" of diamond-aligner
# software. By default, this file will be named "all_data_db.dmnd".
diamond_database: results/all_data_db.dmnd

# The path of the diamond blatp file created by the command "blastp" of diamond-aligner software.
# By default, this file will be named "diamond_ssn"
diamond_blastp: results/diamond_ssn

# The name of the file containing the index associated with the sequence (to reduce memory usage).
indices: seqname_index.indices

# ===================================== DISTRIBUTION GRAPHS ====================================== #

distribution:
  - overlap
  - identity
  - evalue


# ========================================== FILTRATION ========================================== #


# Put the filtration parameter you want to use to filter the blastp.
# note that the filtration will always be >= of the value you put on this parameter.

filtration:
  overlap:
  identity:
  evalue:

# If you already have filtered file(s), you can put their path below, else, leave blank
filtered_files:


# ========================================== ATTRIBUTES ========================================== #


# File(s) containing the attributes associated to the sequences ID.
#annotation: an/*
annotation: an_files_test/*

# If you already have an attributes table, you can put the path to it here, else, leave blank
attributes: 

# Columns you want to keep in you sequence similarity network (please put them in the same order as
# in your file)
# Example:

# If your file looks like this :

# peptides | length | database | date
# 1        | 100    | A        | 12-06-19
# 2        | 105    | B        | 12-06-19

# If you only want the first three columns as attributes for you sequence similarity network,
# the section "columns" of the config file should be like this :
# columns:
#   - peptides
#   - length
#   - database

columns:
  - peptides
  - length
  - database


# ========================================== CONVERSION ========================================== #


# If you have a diamond blatp output already filtered but not converted to Igraph input, type "true"
# else, leave blank
conversion: true


# ======================================= NETWORK CREATION ======================================= #


# If you want to extract information of a preformed network saved in a file,
# type the path of the file containing the graph, else, leave blank
network_file:

# The number of minimum neighbours you want in your connected components of the sequence similarity
# network
neighbours: 3

# If you want to REMOVE ISOLATED nodes, insert "yes", else leave blank.
isolated: yes
